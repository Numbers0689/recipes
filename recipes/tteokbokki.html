        <h2 class="disc">tteok-BOKKI, a cheesy, creamy flavor with a hint of Korean spiciness</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Tteokbokki is a dish made of chewy Korean rice cakes simmered in a spicy, sweet, and creamy sauce. This variation of tteokbokki is less fiery than the traditional recipe and offers a creamy, mild flavor that even those who are not accustomed to spicy dishes can enjoy. The original rosé sauce is a blend of tomato sauce and cream, creating a beautiful pinkish-orange hue and it is used as a pasta sauce. Rosé tteokbokki follows the same principle but, instead of using tomato sauce, it uses gochujang based spicy Korean chili sauce.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <p></p>
        <div class="bordered">
            <ul>
                <li>50g / 1.7 ounces onion, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>30g / 1 ounce cabbage, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>15g / 0.5 ounces green onion, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>Korean rice cake</li>
                <li>Korean fish cake</li>
                <li>kabana minis</li>
                <li>1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
                <li> Tbsp parmesan cheese, grated</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <p></p>
        <div class="bordered">
            <ol>
                <li>Combine gochujang, sugar, soy sauce, and gochugaru in a small bowl. Mix them well and set it aside.</li>
                <li>In a heated pan, add the cooking oil, then onion, cabbage, and green onion. Stir fry them until lightly wilted, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium low.</li>
                <li>Add the heavy cream and milk and stir until fully combined with the gochujang sauce for a smooth, creamy consistency.</li>
                <li>Add the rice cakes, fish cakes, and sausage to your pan. Then increase the heat to medium high so the sauce starts to boil. Stir often until the rice cakes have softened, being careful not to overcook them, as overcooked rice cakes can become mushy.</li>
                <li>Once the sauce is reduced and the other ingredients are evenly coated with it, sprinkle the cheese around the dish evenly. Give it a few moments to melt and produce a cheesy, creamy texture, then serve.</li>
            </ol>
