        <h2 class="disc">kim-BOP, sushi with the wasabi swapped and in a seaweed wrap!</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>A Korean dish made from cooked rice, vegetables, fish, and meat rolled in gim—dried sheets of seaweed—and served in bite-sized slices. The rice is seasoned with sesame oil and a pinch of salt, giving it a smooth, nutty flavor. The oil that is mixed with the rice helps to keep kimpab from drying out. This means that these rolls can be made up to a day ahead of time and refrigerated until you are ready to eat them. So they are perfect for a make-ahead lunch or picnic! And it does resemble sushi but thats for another day.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 dried seaweed sheets</li>
            <li>Regular or baby spinach</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>Julienned</li>
            <li>2 to 4 imitation crab sticks</li>
            <li>sticks of BBQ Kimbap ham</li>
            <li>4 yellow radish pickle</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <p></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the spinach and parboil it in rapidly boiling water (30 seconds to 1 minute). Drain the water away and run some cold water over the spinach. Gently squeeze the spinach to remove any excess water. Put the spinach into a bowl. Add 1/8 tsp salt and 1/2 Tbsp sesame oil then mix them well.</li>
            <li>Pre-heat a pan/skillet. Add a small dash of cooking oil and spread it around the pan. Add the beaten egg and cook both sides well over medium heat. Place the egg omelette on a cutting board and cut it into long strips.</li>
            <li>In a heated pan, lightly cook the carrots, crab sticks and kimbap ham (about 1 min per ingredients), separately, and over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Place the cooked rice into a mixing bowl then add 1/2 Tbsp sesame oil and 1/4 tsp fine sea salt.</li>
            <li>Now fill the seaweed with the filing ingredients. Make sure you evenly use the ingredients so that youre not short of them later.</li>
            <li>Place one yellow radish pickle at about 1/3 point of the seaweed then add three burdock strips, one ham strip, one crab stick around it. Then pile up a few eggs strips, carrot sticks, and some spinach. Then roll the seaweed.</li>
        </ol>
