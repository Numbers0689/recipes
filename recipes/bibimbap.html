        <p>Bibimbap simply translates to “mixed rice with meat and assorted vegetables“. You can make endless variations to this dish depending on your preference and dietary requirements. This beloved Korean bowl incorporates steamed white rice with assorted fresh, marinated, and sautéed vegetables along with raw or seared meat, if desired. Dolsot bibimbap is the version that is served in a hot stone bowl. Even if people dont know anything about Korea, its not too difficult to find people who had bibimbap sometime in their lives.</p>
